# Kolmogorov–Arnold–Siddarth Sampling Theorem (KAS)
### Reproducible Empirical Evidence Repository

This repository contains the complete, executable empirical evidence supporting the **Kolmogorov–Arnold–Siddarth (KAS) Sampling Theorem**.  
All simulations, figures, tables, and appendix-level validations reported in the accompanying manuscript are generated from a **single Jupyter notebook**, ensuring transparency, traceability, and full reproducibility.

What This Repository Contains

Executable empirical validation of the KAS Sampling Theorem

Finite-window RF signal simulations at 10 MHz and 1.75 GHz

Stochastic noise models (Gaussian, Brownian, Gaussian mixture)

Spline-based Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks (KANs)

Observables O1–O6, fully aligned with Appendix A

Fixed-number figures and tables exactly as referenced in the manuscript

All reported values are computed directly from stochastic simulations and are not hard-coded.

Reproducibility Statement (for Reviewers)

All results are generated by executing KAS_Evidence.ipynb top-to-bottom

No internet access, pretrained models, or proprietary software is required

Random seeds and configurations are controlled within the notebook

The notebook executes on standard consumer hardware (CPU-only)

This repository satisfies reproducibility expectations outlined in:

Goodman et al. (2016)

ACM / IEEE artifact evaluation guidelines

How to Review (Editor & Reviewer Note)

To reproduce all figures, tables, and appendix results, simply open KAS_Evidence.ipynb and run all cells in order—no additional setup is required.

Citation

If you use or reference this work, please cite it using the provided CITATION.cff file.
GitHub and Zenodo will automatically generate a formatted citation.

Scope and Limitations

This repository focuses on functional approximation under sampling, not waveform reconstruction.
Empirical validation is provided for quadratic and bilinear RF functionals (power and finite-lag correlations), as discussed in Section 6 of the manuscript.
